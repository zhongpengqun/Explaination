sub: Subscription
/exp/
Represents a disposable resource, such as the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe, that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription.
Additionally, subscriptions may be grouped together through the add() method, which will attach a child Subscription to the current Subscription. When a Subscription is unsubscribed, all its children (and its grandchildren) will be unsubscribed as well.

- RxJS是一种针对异步数据流编程工具，或者叫响应式扩展编程；可不管如何解释RxJS其目标就是异步编程，Angular引入RxJS为了就是让异步可控、更简单。
- Subscription类的另一个重要作用是帮助我们避免内存泄漏。内存泄漏通常发生在我们忘记取消订阅可观察对象时，导致不再需要的组件或服务仍然保持对这些可观察对象的引用。在Angular中，我们可以通过在组件销毁时取消订阅来防止内存泄漏
