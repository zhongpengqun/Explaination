- Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. 
	- It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.
- Dependencies can be injected into objects by many means (such as constructor injection or setter injection).
